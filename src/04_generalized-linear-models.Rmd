## Extending the linear model using link functions 
The linear models that we have looked at so far have 2 basic components. Recall the Boston house prices model we worked on last session. The components of the model we built were: 

1. Random component: the y-variable 
2. Linear predicto: the x-variables and the coefficients associated with them (betas) 

We're now going to move to a more general type of model, which has three components: 
1. Random component 
2. Linear predictor
3. Link function 

Todo: image of link function, etc.
